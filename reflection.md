- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I thought the concept of Inheritance was interesting and made it easier to make the different buildings. It was cool to see how I could make multiple different classes that all related to each other. For this assignment especially, I did a lotttt of looking up the java documentation online, espeically for the newer stuff like hashtables, which was really helpful. Honestly, I was kind of nervous about this assignment because of the classes interacting and everything, but the assignment wasn't as crazy impossible as I thought it would be.
